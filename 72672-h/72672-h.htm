<p class="f120"><b>THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE GHOST.</b></p>
</div>

<hr class="r10">

<p>When the Hyde Park second Great Exhibition in 1862 had closed its
doors, and the reaction from the bustle attendant on the arrival
and departure of country visitors had set in, so that the halls and
lecture rooms lately crowded with the numerous patrons of the old
Royal Polytechnic were somewhat deserted, there came to the aid of the
Institute a new invention, which people by common consent called “The
Ghost.”</p>

<p>The latter was matured in this wise:—Mr. Dircks, a patent agent, who
had saved some property and was an independent man, wrote a paper
for the <i>Athenæum Literary Journal</i>, in which he described an
optical effect that could be performed with sheets of glass. This paper
excited no attention because the explanation of it was somewhat vague
and unsatisfactory. The Christmas of 1862 was fast approaching, when
Messrs. Horne, Thornthwaite, and Wood, philosophical instrument makers,
of Newgate Street, invited the author to see a model which Mr. Dircks
had caused to be constructed. This was the beginning of the Ghost;
but as Mr. Dircks said that an entirely new theatre must be built to
show the effects which he allowed could only be seen by a few people
placed in an upper gallery, and then only by <i>daylight</i>, it was
no wonder that the Crystal Palace, the Colosseum, and other places had
all declined to have anything to do with Mr. Dircks or his model, which
was now placed in the hands of Professor Pepper—so called because the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
Directors of the then Royal Polytechnic had determined that his
title should be Professor of Chemistry and Honorary Director of
the above Institution. The title was not that of a hair-dresser or
a dancing-master, but was conferred upon him by express minute of
the Board of Directors. Professor Pepper had had his services in
establishing classes at the Royal Polytechnic already recognised by
the authorities at South Kensington, who gave him an honorary diploma
in Physics and Chemistry of the Committee of Council on Education some
two or three years before the ghost was brought out, and at a time
when he was sole lessee of the Polytechnic at a rental of £2,480 per
annum, which had to be paid before a single lecture or entertainment
was brought before the public. The classes Mr. Pepper established were
for the study of Drawing, French, German, Arithmetic, and Mathematics,
with, of course, Chemistry and Physics; and pupils were admitted at
very low fees in order to encourage the working men to attend. He also
arranged Monday evening lectures for the working classes, and reduced
the admission to sixpence if the workmen came with proper tickets
supplied by Professor Pepper, but signed by the foreman under whom the
men worked.</p>

<p>All this took place about the years 1858-9, and was continued until
the Institute finally closed its doors, principally caused by the fall
of the stone staircase, and sold all off to a new limited liability
company when Mr. Pepper was giving courses of lectures at the Crystal
Palace, Sydenham. Again, for the last time, and during the absence of
Professor Pepper in Australia, where he stopped ten years, viz., from
1879 to 1889, a sale of the plant and machinery, &amp;c., of the Royal
Polytechnic took place, on the 28th of February and three following
days in 1882. Mr. George Buckland and his friends tried to secure the
lease by purchase; but, not completing the purchase in time, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
bought by Quintin Hogg, Esq., who has greatly added to the size of
the building, which is chiefly devoted to classes, at least fifty
in number, teaching all kinds of useful knowledge, with a large day
school for boys, who are numbered by hundreds, and are well and most
efficiently taught by competent masters. The Laboratory has also been
enlarged, and is now under the able guidance of Mr. Ward, the teacher
of Chemistry and Physics.</p>

<p>But to return to the Christmas of 1862, ever memorable in the annals of
the Institute because Mr. Pepper brought out the illusion in quite a
different manner from that contemplated by Mr. Dircks, and so improved
and simplified the ghost that it could be shown in any lecture hall or
theatre, if sufficiently large to contain the necessary apparatus.</p>

<p class="spb2">The following is a narrative from the lips of the
inventor of the ghost improvement:—“Just before Christmas Day in 1862,
I invited a number of literary and scientific friends, and my always
kind supporters, the members of the press, to a private view of the
new illusion to be introduced into Bulwer’s romantic and dramatic
literary creation, called ‘A Strange Story.’ The effect of the first
appearance of the apparition on my illustrious audience was startling
in the extreme, and far beyond anything I could have hoped for and
expected, so much so that, although I had previously settled to explain
the whole <i>modus operandi</i> on that evening, I deferred doing so,
and went the next day to Messrs. Carpmael, the patent agents, and took
out a provisional patent for the ghost illusion, in the names, at my
request, of Dircks and Pepper. The day after the first evening I showed
the ghost, Mr. Dircks came down to the Polytechnic, and after saying
how much pleased he was with the manner in which I had introduced the
illusion, ended by handing me a letter, in which he spoke highly of
my work in respect of the ghost, and gave me spontaneously whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
profits might accrue from the invention. Moreover, he went to Carpmael
with me, and, being an old and experienced patent agent himself,
assisted in drawing up the patent which is here copied, with my
original drawing of the improved method of showing the ghost by the use
of a ‘Double Stage,’ at the old Royal Polytechnic Institute.”</p>

Director of the Polytechnic Institution, for the Invention of
“<span class="smcap">Improvements in Apparatus to be used in

<p class="neg-indent">Sealed the 25th September 1863, in pursuance of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span></p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Provisional
Specification</span> left by the said Henry Dircks and John Henry
Pepper at the Office of the Commissioners of Patents, with their
Petition, on the 5th February 1863.</p>

<p>We, <span class="smcap">Henry Dircks</span>, of Blackheath,
in the County of Kent, Civil Engineer, and <span class="smcap">John Henry Pepper</span>,
of No. 309, Regent Street, in the County of Middlesex, Professor of
Chemistry, and Honorary Director of the Polytechnic Institution,
do hereby declare the nature of the Invention for “<span class="smcap">Improvements
in Apparatus to be used in the Exhibition of Dramatic and other like Performances</span>,”
to be as follows:—</p>

<p>The object of our said Invention is by a peculiar arrangement of
apparatus to associate on the same stage a phantom or phantoms with a
living actor or actors, so that the two may act in concert, but which
is only an optical illusion as respects the one or more phantoms so
introduced.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the theatre requires in addition to the ordinary
stage a second stage at a lower level than the ordinary one, hidden
from the audience as far as direct vision is concerned; this hidden
stage is to be strongly illuminated by artificial light, and is capable
of being rendered dark instantaneously whilst the ordinary stage and
the theatre remain illuminated by ordinary lighting. A large glass
screen is placed on the ordinary stage and in front of the hidden one.</p>

<p>The spectators will not observe the glass screen, but will see the
actors on the ordinary stage through it as if it were not there;
nevertheless the glass will serve to reflect to them an image of the
actors on the hidden stage when these are illuminated, but this image
will be made immediately to disappear by darkening the hidden stage.
The glass screen is set in a frame so that it can readily be moved to
the place required, and it is to be set at an inclination to enable the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
spectators, whether in the pit, boxes, or gallery, to see
the reflected image.</p>

<p>The glass is adjustable and it is readily adjusted to the proper
inclination, by having a person in the pit and another in the gallery
to inform the party who is adjusting the glass when they see the image
correctly.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="neg-indent"><span class="smcap">Specification</span> filed in
pursuance of the conditions of the Letters Patent, and of an Order of
the Lord Chancellor, by the said Henry Dircks and John Henry Pepper in
the Great Seal Patent Office on the 31ˢᵗ October 1863.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To All to Whom These Presents Shall Come</span>, we,
<span class="smcap">Henry Dircks</span>, of Blackheath, in the County of Kent,
Civil Engineer, and <span class="smcap">John Henry Pepper</span>, of No. 309,
Regent Street, in the County of Middlesex, Professor of Chemistry, and
Honorary Director of the Polytechnic Institution, send greeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> Her most Excellent Majesty Queen Victoria,
by Her Letters Patent, bearing Date the Fifth Day of February, in the year
of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, in the
twenty-sixth year of Her reign, did, for Herself, Her heirs and
successors, give and grant unto us, the said Henry Dircks and John
Henry Pepper, Her special licence that we, the said Henry Dircks and
John Henry Pepper, our executors, administrators, and assigns, or
such others as we, the said Henry Dircks and John Henry Pepper, our
executors, administrators, and assigns, should at any time agree with,
and no others, from time to time and at all times thereafter during the
term therein expressed, should and lawfully might make, use, exercise,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
and vend, within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the
Channel Islands, and Isle of Man, an Invention for “<span class="smcap">Improvements
in Apparatus to be used in the Exhibition of Dramatic and other
like Performances</span>,” upon the condition (amongst others) that
we, the said Henry Dircks and John Henry Pepper, our executors or
administrators, by an instrument in writing under our or their hands
and seals, or under the hand and seal of one of us or them, should
particularly describe and ascertain the nature of the said Invention,
and in what manner the same was to be performed, and cause the same to
be filed in the Great Seal Patent Office on or before the Third day
of November, in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and
sixty-three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now Know Ye</span>, that I, the said John Henry
Pepper, on behalf of myself and the said Henry Dircks, do hereby
declare the nature of the said Invention, and in what manner the same
is to be performed, to be particularly described and ascertained in and
by the following statement thereof, that is to say:—</p>

<p>The nature and object of our said Invention is by a peculiar
arrangement of apparatus to associate on the same stage a phantom or
phantoms with a living actor or actors, so that the two may act in
concert, but which is only an optical illusion as respects the one or
more phantoms so introduced.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the theatre requires in addition to the ordinary
stage a second stage at a lower level than the ordinary one, hidden
from the audience as far as direct vision is concerned; this hidden
stage is to be strongly illuminated by artificial light, and is capable
of being rendered dark instantaneously whilst the ordinary stage and
the theatre remain illuminated by ordinary lighting. A large glass
screen is placed on the ordinary stage and in front of the hidden one.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
The spectators will not observe the glass screen, but will see the
actors on the ordinary stage through it as if it were not there;
nevertheless the glass will serve to reflect to them an image of the
actors on the hidden stage when these are illuminated, but this image
will be made immediately to disappear by darkening the hidden stage.
The glass screen is set in a frame so that it can readily be moved to
the place required, and it is to be set at an inclination to enable the
spectators, whether in the pit, boxes, or gallery, to see the reflected
image. The glass is adjustable and it is readily adjusted to the proper
inclination by having a person in the pit, and another in the gallery,
to inform the party who is adjusting the glass when they see the image
correctly.</p>

<p>Having thus stated the nature of our Invention, we will proceed more
fully to describe the manner of performing the same.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p id="DESCN" class="f110"><span class="smcap">Description of the
Drawings.</span>—Fig. 1.<br>(<a href="#FRONTIS"><i>Frontispiece</i></a>).</p>

<p>Figure 1 of the annexed Drawings illustrates the arrangement of a
theatre for carrying our Invention into effect; the Figure shows a
section taken through the stage, the orchestra, the pit, and gallery.</p>

<p><i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, is an opening which is formed in the ordinary
stage. In the front part of the stage, but at a lower level, is the
hidden stage <i>b</i>. The opening <i>a</i> is capable of being closed
at the top by trap doors, a plan of which is shewn at <a href="#FRONTIS">Figure 2</a>.
When the trap doors are closed, actors on the ordinary or visible stage can
pass freely to and fro above the lower or hidden stage. The ordinary
stage and trap doors are covered with green baize or other dark
material, so that when the trap doors are opened, the audience, even
those in the gallery, will not readily be able to perceive the opening.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
The actors or objects corresponding with the phantom images, which it
is desired to represent to the audience, are on the lower or hidden
stage <i>b</i>, and are strongly illuminated by the lime light or the
electric light, or other powerful illuminating means may be employed.
This light must accompany the actor in any movement he has to make.
The hidden stage <i>b</i>, and the lanterns <i>c</i>, may be mounted
on a carriage on rails (a plan of which is shown at <a href="#FRONTIS">Figure 3</a>),
so that when it is necessary for the phantom actor or object on the lower stage
to be moved, the lanterns may be caused to move also, or the lanterns
may remain stationary whilst the actor moves, provided the whole space
through which he moves is sufficiently illuminated. The lanterns are
to be provided with means for instantaneously extinguishing or masking
the light, and for reproducing it so that the phantom may be made
to disappear and reappear at pleasure, whilst the audience and the
ordinary stage will be more or less lighted in the ordinary manner
according to the effects desired to be obtained. For this purpose a
board <i>b</i>¹ is employed, which is capable of being raised into the
position shewn by dotted lines so as entirely to cut off the light from
the hidden stage when desired, or an ordinary opaque shade attached to
each lantern may be used for the purpose, or when using the lime light
the desired effects are caused by gradually or instantaneously (as the
case may require) cutting off the supply of gases, and the phantom
image may by any of these means be caused gradually or instantaneously
to fade away. When the trap doors over the hidden stage are open, the
part <i>d</i> thereof assists in hiding the lanterns and the opening
from the audience. The part <i>e</i> is raised into the position shown
in the Drawing and acts (together with the part <i>d</i>) to screen the
lanterns from the audience, and also to insure that any actor or object
on the hidden stage shall not accidentally appear above the level of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
the visible stage. The phantom actor, when standing on the stage
<i>b</i>, leans against the screen <i>k</i>, which is inclined so as
to be parallel with the glass screen, and is covered with black velvet
or other dark material, as is also the stage <i>b</i>, in order that
no image of either the screen <i>k</i> or the stage <i>b</i> may be
seen in the reflection. <i>f</i> (the glass screen) is a large sheet
of plate glass on the ordinary stage, of sufficient size to reflect
the full length of the actors or objects on the hidden stage to the
audience in the pit, boxes, and galleries of the theatre. The hidden
stage is between the glass and the audience. The glass may be mounted
in a swing frame so that it may be adjusted to the angle required, or
it may readily be done by screws or ropes and pulleys, or otherwise.
The glass screen is to be set at such an inclination as to bring the
reflected image to the level of the visible or ordinary stage. This
will enable the spectators, whether in pit, boxes, or gallery, to see
the reflected image without any obstruction to the view above the
foot-lights, and it will be visible from all parts of the house except
those extreme positions which cannot command a view through the glass
of that part of the stage where the image is reflected.</p>

<p>The proper angle of inclination of the glass is ascertained
experimentally by having persons in the different parts of the house
to say when the image is shewn to them correctly. The scenery is so
disposed as to conceal the frame of the glass, and we prefer that the
glass should be able to descend into an opening or box <i>g</i> beneath
the stage, in which case we counterbalance the glass and frame so that
they may easily be raised into the position desired by means of a rope
<i>h</i>, by which, aided by the bolts <i>i</i>, the glass is supported
in the required position. The glass may either be adjusted when
screened from the audience, and remain in position during the scene, or
(the proper angle of inclination having been previously ascertained by
experiment) the glass may be raised on to the ordinary or visible stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
and placed in position whilst the scene is before the eyes of the
audience under a subdued light without the movement being observed, for
which latter purpose the top bar of the frame of the glass should be
made very light or be omitted altogether. This arrangement admits of
an actor on the visible stage passing across the space which the glass
is to occupy, and this he can do just before the appearance of the
phantom, and then immediately the glass is run up, the trap doors are
opened, the actor or image on the hidden stage is illuminated and the
phantom appears. This arrangement will render it less likely that the
audience should imagine that there is anything interposed between them
and the actors than if the glass plate remained permanently in position
during the scene. The hidden or lower stage may be provided with a well
or hole up which an actor can rise; he will then appear as a spectre
rising out of the visible stage. The lanterns may be provided with
coloured glasses in order to heighten the effect. As the actors on the
visible stage do not themselves see the spectral images, marks should
be placed on the stage or other indications made in order that they may
know the position which the spectres appearing to the audience are to
occupy. In order to appear upright upon the visible stage the actor or
object on the hidden stage should be inclined so as to be as nearly as
practicable parallel with the surface of the glass screen. In effecting
this assistance is afforded by the screen <i>k</i> of the hidden
stage. Several sheets of glass may be similarly employed at the same
time if one is not of sufficient width to cover the different parts of
the stage at which it is desired that the spectre should appear, the
interval or junction being concealed by the introduction of a tree or
column or some other piece of scenery.</p>

<p>Having thus described the nature of our Invention and the manner of
performing the same, we would have it understood that we make no claim
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
to any of the parts separately, but what we claim is the combined
arrangement as herein described of a glass inclined forwards towards
the audience, and two stages, one the ordinary visible stage, and the
other a hidden stage at a lower level than the ordinary visible stage
and illuminated with a much stronger light than either the ordinary
visible stage or the body of the house, and which light is capable of
being instantaneously, or, if so required, gradually withdrawn and restored.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa1">In witness whereof, I, the said John Henry
Pepper, have hereunto set my hand and seal, this Thirty-first day
of October, in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and
sixty-three.</p>

shown in what was called the small theatre of the Royal Polytechnic,
but as the audience increased so rapidly it was removed by the
following Easter and shown on a grander scale in the large theatre of
the Institution, and where the dissolving views were usually exhibited.</p>

<p>The late Mr. O’Connor, of the Haymarket, painted the first scene used,
representing the laboratory of “The Haunted Man,” which Christmas story
the late Charles Dickens, by his special written permission, allowed
me to use for the illustration of the Ghost illusion. This ghost scene
ran for fifteen months, and helped to realise, in a very short time,
the sum of twelve thousand pounds, not counting what I received for
granting licences to use the Ghost, and also the sums realised during
many successive years as new ghost stories were brought out.</p>

<p>Sylvester now patented the use of looking-glass in the performance of
the Ghost, which I thought very good, and bought of him—he could only
infringe my patent by attempting to use it, and therefore his patent
was useless to anybody else but myself.

<p>Mr. King, of Bath, brought out what he termed a “New Patent Ghost”; but
my solicitors, Messrs. Hughes, Masterman, and Hughes, very soon quashed
the alleged patent by appearing against Mr. King, when he tried to get
his patent passed before the Solicitor-General, the result of which is
thus described by</p>

<p class="center">WITHDRAWAL OF THE GHOST FROM<br>
THE LONDON NEW MUSIC HALL.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is with unfeigned regret that I have to announce
to my numerous patrons the withdrawal of the Ghost from the London New
Music Hall. The reason is as follows:—My engagement with Mr. King, to
whom a large sum of money was paid down, was with the understanding
that he should personally superintend the first representation of
the “Great Optical Illusion, the Marvellous Ghost,” which, however,
he failed to do, and to which is attributable the failure and
disappointment which ensued. I also distinctly understood that his
representation was free from any infringement of the right of patent,
and that it was in every respect equal to the original production of
Professor Pepper. I beg, therefore, in order to acquit myself from the
odium of disappointment which may have been felt by the unusually large
attraction which it has occasioned to “The London” during the past
week, to state that I have received an intimation from Professor Pepper
that Mr. King’s representation is an infringement upon his own, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
I have no course left open to me but at once to bear the
disappointment, and allow its immediate withdrawal. It is my intention,
however, to seek redress in the proper quarter.</p>

<p>I therefore trust that my numerous friends will see the predicament in
which I have been placed, and readily acquit me of all blame; assuring
them that I am at all times, regardless of expense, anxious to secure
the most sterling talent that can be procured, and to avoid anything in
the shape of disappointment.</p>

<p>I now introduced a Miniature Ghost of a danseuse, which, being only
about fifteen inches high, danced on the stage to the great amusement
of my very numerous kind patrons.</p>

<p>I took out a provisional patent for this addition to the Ghost
Mysteries, and shall reproduce it this Christmas at the Polytechnic.</p>

ridicules the efforts made by King to produce the Ghost at Manchester:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TH’ GHOST!!!</h2>

<p>“When aw wur a lad—(but that wurnt yusterday, nor th’ day before,
nor any day last wick)—aw used to be trayted neaw and then to wot wur
cawd a good ghost story. Owd foak then wur vast fond o’ ticklin’ yung
foaks’ yers wi’ tales abeawt hobgoblins, ghosts, carnivorous giants,
vampyres, ogres, un aw macks o’ uncouth beeins. Aw railly believe they
thowt sitch tales wur profitable, morally un’ religiously speighkin’,
un’ had little thowt abeauwt th’ uproar ’ut they caused amung eawr
juvenoile nerves. Weel con aw remember beein’ neaw un then freetunt
till it wur th’ herdest job i’ th’ world to keep my heart fro’ other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
roisin’ up into my meawth, or skutterin’ deawn in t’ clugs. My yure
would ha’ stood up loike th’ bristles uv a dleetin’ brush, un’ th’
best com ut ever wur made would ha’ fawn a victim to any attempt to
smooth it deawn to its gradely place; nay, aw believe if anybuddy had
tried wi’ a par o’ curlin’ tungs to make it twist, they’d ha’ brokken
um loike owd chips. These tales gien me no partikilur noshun as to wot
ghosts wur; praps th’ tellers had no very clear ideo theirsels; but
aw geet o sort uv a general inklin’ ’ut they wur a very quare, a very
extriordinary, un a very wilful set o’ beeins; some on um vast fond
uv a toidy practical joke; un aw on um i’ their element when they wur
potterin’ foaks’ plucks to make eawt wot the dickens they meant by
their merlocks.</p>

<p>“For some days th’ good foaks o’th’ city o’ Manchester have had
before their een uppo’ th’ waws, un’ i’th’ shop windows, bills printed
i’ black un flarin’ red ink, th’ letters big enoof welly for a bloint
chap to see, anneawncin’ at th’ Lunnun New Music Haw th’ appearance
uv a ‘Mervellous Ghost’—<i>King’s</i> Ghost! as a roival to that
uv Professor Pepper. Loike aw curious foak ’ut are made hongry wi’
expectashun, aw went th’ other neet to have a look at it, imaginin’, as
aw went alung through th’ streets, that at last aw should get a peep at
a spectre uz would carry back my moind to my yung days, un gie me some
inseet into th’ naytur and essence uv sperrits—not sitch as one beighs
at th’ keawnter uv a <i>vault</i>, but sitch as proceed fro’ th’ clay
tenement that lies, moshunless, decayin’ within. Aw durnt know but aw
felt a little bit sayrious too, un’ a tunchy bit groiped wi’ fear, for
it met be that th’ seet would be made doubly awful by th’ appearance uv
my gronny’s ghost; if it wur, un hoo seed me, hoo’d be shure t’ gie me
a blisterin wi’ hur tung, for hoo wur a raddler at takkin’ th’ sheighne
eawt on me wi’ that glib little member uv hus. But when th’ ghost did
appear—or <i>should</i> have appeart in its full proposhuns, by th’
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
mack aw fun’ mysel as far fro th’ possesshun uv a genuine crumb o’
ghostly wisdum uz ever aw wur i’ my born days. It should ha’ bin an
illustrious ghost—no less a chap than Owd Hamlet, th’ suvverin uv
anyshunt Denmark; un’ theerefore a rail <i>King’s</i> ghost (beawt
patent). But that may akeawnt fer its peevishness, its tricks, un’ its
uncommon way o’ introducin’ itsel’. It wouldn’t appear aw at wonst; at
fust it showed its yed; then, giving itsel’ a wry neck, it lugged in
its showders un its breast; then it disappeart, un’ shortly begun to
ascend wi’ its legs un’ feet, or else a pair uz it had borrowed fro’ a
nayburin’ corpse, uppermost; un’ when it had getten so far in seet as
its sternum, it flittert abeawt in an ungrayshus manner, as if tryin’
to doance th’ Cure on its yed. Praps it wur <i>because</i> it wur a
<i>King’s</i> ghost that it wur so wilful, un’ tried to be so unnatural
in its ways, for some o’ th’ owd kings wur rum jockies, un’, for owt
we know, owd Hamlet met be loike owd George Thard, who, Byron says,
geet into heaven by mistake, wi’ his yed under his arm, not havin’ any
use for it in a place wheere good thowts un good principles are alone
acceptable. Owd Hamlet met be labburin’ under an idea that Lankishire
wur a place in which a chap would be uv as mitch service to his felly
crayturs when stonnin’ on his yed as when reort up i’ th’ ushual style
on his feet.</p>

<p>“This ghostly bizness is cawd an ‘optical illushun.’ Shouldn’t it be
cawd an ‘optical <i>delushun</i>’? Aw know aw never seed as monny pairs
o’ optics so noicely chetted as there wur on this occashun. Professor
Buck’s kunjurashuns we know beforehond are nowt but decepshuns; but
aw’ll be flogged if i’th’ way o’ bamboozlin’ one’s wits, un’ makin th’
sense uv seet counifogle aw eawr other senses, he isn’t far ayed o’
King’s ghost—a very prince besoide a regilur muff.</p>

<p>“Neaw Pepper’s ghosts, they say, are genuine, are wot they’re
professed to be—foine specimens uv wot true science un’ profershunal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
skill con accomplish. When aw th’ whole bevy o’ King’s ghosts are
<i>mustert</i>, they’re not, placed alungsoide o’ one <i>Pepper</i>,
wuth so mitch as a pinch o’ <i>sawt</i>; though, by th’ way ’at they
try to catch owd brids, they met have a lerge stock on hond o’ th’
latter herticle.</p>

<p>“But, moind yoa, aw dunnot blame Mestur Harwood, th’ lesse o’
th’ Haw. Now, not I; he, aw understond, has been done as weel, nay
to a bigger tune, than th’ public; un’ that he’s doubly vext to
think that he should, aimin’ at producin’ every novelty ’ut’s wuth
presentin’ to th’ public, pay his good money for a bad ghost! Un’ to
aw th’ professhunals engaged at th’ establishment it mun be awfully
mortifyin’; for wot gives ’um th’ horrors mooar than an ominous
convicshun that th’ <i>ghost winnot wawk</i>? Heawever, if awm reetly
informt, King’s ghost is to vanish, un’ Pepper’s is to appear in
its place. This shows a determinashun not to be done wi’ a pousy
Jack-o-lantern.</p>

<p>“By th’ <i>Music Haw Journal</i> aw see too that Stead, th’ original
Cure, un’ Mestur Ware, th’ author uv so monny comic sungs, are to
appear next wick. Booath o’ theese chaps aw seed i’ Lunnun, when aw
went to look at th’ Eggsibishun; un’, my word, if they dunnot make
Lankishire foak lowf away aw unpleasant dreoms, un’ shift aw th’
bile left by th’ ghost, awm no judge, that’s aw! So, there’s no need
to despair. As Shakspere says, ‘Shadows avaunt!’ un’ make way for
substanshul entertainments.—Yours gradely,</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, 1863, the audiences increased enormously at
the Royal Polytechnic, so that it became necessary to have a select
afternoon performance, the admission fee being raised from 1s. to
2s. 6d. on Saturday mornings only. It was at this period that I was
honoured with a visit from their Royal Highnesses the Prince and
Princess of Wales and suite; and after the performance had been
witnessed by them, I showed the Prince and Princess how the ghost was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
raised, and explained to my distinguished audience all the machinery
and appliances used. Some of the suite amused the Prince by becoming
ghosts, and the following notice appeared the next morning in the
<i>Times</i>, May 20th, 1863:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Yesterday morning, by special command, Professor Pepper had the
honour of delivering his ghost lecture before their Royal Highnesses
the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Prince and Princess
Louis of Hesse, who were attended by the Countess of Macclesfield,
Baroness Von Schenck, Major Teesdale, and Captain Westerweller. The
distinguished party were received by Professor Pepper, and after being
conducted round the galleries passed to the large theatre, where a
commodious Royal box had been prepared for their reception. At the
conclusion of the lecture, by the invitation of Professor Pepper,
they went behind the scenes, and examined with much interest the
machinery and appliances for producing the Polytechnic ‘ghost.’ At the
conclusion, their Royal Highnesses graciously thanked the directors
of the institution, and after shaking hands with Professor Pepper,
retired.”—<i>The Times, May 20th, London, England.</i></p>

<p>“The ghosts of the Polytechnic, which manifest themselves as a
startling appendix to Mr. Pepper’s ‘Strange Lecture’ on optical
illusions, have proved singularly attractive, and when the hour arrives
for their appearance the lecture room becomes as crowded as the pit of
a theatre on the night of Boxing-day.”—<i>(Second Notice), The Times,
Jan. 20th, London, England.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The real element of success in the production of “The Strange Story,”
however, must be assigned to the ghost.</p>

<p>So many base and servile imitators now appeared with a sorry imitation
of the Polytechnic ghost that it became necessary to send the following
advertisement to all the London papers:—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The famous <i>savant</i> Mon. l’Abbé Moigné, of Paris, wrote
the brief notice of the ghost which is here copied from his
journal called <i>Les Mondes</i>, May, 1863:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NOUVELLES ET FAITS DIVERS.</h2>

<div lang="fr" class="blockquot">
<p class="center spb1"><span class="smcap">Royal Polytechnic Institution.</span></p>

<p>“Les énergiques directeurs de l’Institution royale polytechnique
ont inauguré une série de matinées fashionables amusantes du samedi
qui, à en juger par les deux séances déjà données, promettent un
très-heureux succès. On a surtout remarqué le leçon expérimentale de
M. Pepper, sur le thallium, sur les merveilles de l’analyse spectrale,
et la part qu’elle a eue à la découverte du nouveau métal. En raison
du beau monde qu’elles devaient recevoir, les galeries avaient été
tapissées et décorées avec goût de plantes exotiques rares. Comme
intermède, on avait choisi le <i>Freischütz</i>, qui n’a rien perdu
de sa fraîcheur et de son attrait, au triple point de vue musical,
optique et humoristique. La semaine dernière, LL. AA. RR. le prince et
la princesse de Galles ont fait une visite privée à cet incomparable
établissement, et elles ont voulu qu’on les initiât aux mystères
des fantômes. M. Pepper n’a pas cru pouvoir mieux répondre à leurs
désirs qu’en faisant apparaître, sous forme de spectre, à leur grande
surprise, une des personnes même de leur suite.</p>

<p>“Depuis que ce petit article a paru dans les journaux anglais, notre
ami, M. Pepper, est venu installer à Paris, au théâtre impérial du
Châtelet, le mystérieux appareil avec lequel il réalise ses apparitions
fantastiques. De son côté, M. Robin a inauguré, samedi dernier, dans la
salle déjà si fréquentée du faubourg du Temple, ses représentations de
spectres vivants impalpables. L’attention publique étant ainsi vivement
excitée, il nous semble que le moment est venu de rappeler l’article
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
suivant inséré par nous dans le <i>Cosmos</i> de 1858, tome XIII, p.
563, et qui ne fut pas assez remarqué, parce que le moment n’était sans
doute pas venu:—</p>

<p>“‘<i>Fantômes optiques.</i>—MM. Dircks et Pepper ont inventé une
charmante disposition optique à l’aide de laquelle il fait apparaître
des spectres et produit des illusions singulières. Il partage en deux
compartiments, par une large glace sans tain, comme on en fait beaucoup
aujourd’hui, la salle dans laquelle la scène doit se jouer. Dans le
premier compartiment, en avant, il place les acteurs dont on ne devra
voir que les images, destinées à représenter les spectres ou revenants;
dans le second compartiment, à droite, il installe les acteurs qui
devront être vus en personne; les spectateurs sont installés dans
l’obscurité, au-dessus du premier compartiment en avant. Dans cette
disposition, évidemment, si la scène commence, les spectateurs verront
directement, à travers la glace, les acteurs du second compartiment;
ils verront par réflexion seulement, ou dans leurs images formées au
sein du premier compartiment et mêlés aux acteurs vus en personne, les
acteurs situés au-dessous d’eux, dans le premier compartiment. Ces
images refléchies, beaucoup moins lumineuses, feront l’effet d’ombres
vivantes, d’êtres revenus de l’autre monde; on pourra les faire
avancer, rétrograder, sortir ou rentrer à travers les murs, en faisant
varier la distance à la glace des acteurs qu’elles représentent, et
l’on obtiendra des effets vraiment extraordinaires. C’est assurément
une excellente idée.’</p>

<p>“C’est bien aussi là le secret de ces photographes spirites dont
l’Amérique a eu l’initiative et qui ont tant fait de bruit.”</p>
</div>

<p class="spa1">And now Mr. Dircks, who had hitherto been most friendly to me,
began to be otherwise, and to write me offensive letters, which I forbear to
publish. Every morning and evening at the Royal Polytechnic I mentioned
his name as a co-inventor. The daily programme always contained his
name, and I can appeal to numbers who know me well that I have never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
attempted to borrow other people’s honours from them, and if a
discovery was made always gave to the person making it full credit
for the same. It is certain that Dircks’ apparatus was comparatively
useless and that he knew nothing of the use of my double stage, and
in fact the Solicitor-General, Sir Roundell Palmer, declined to grant
a patent on Dircks’ crude idea, as it was only when he understood
the great improvement made by the use of the double stage and the
employment of the electric light that he granted (as stated in the
copy of the advertisement) at the third hearing the Ghost Patent which
the Lord Chancellor subsequently ordered to be sealed after great
opposition made by several Music Hall proprietors. It is a very curious
fact that the original model which Horne, Thornthwaite and Wood sent me
was stolen by some person, who in my absence gave a fictitious verbal
order as if from the firm named, and I never saw it again. The thief
could not, however, have derived much benefit from the robbery, as the
model was more likely to lead the possessor in the wrong than the right
direction. I suppose the model went to America or Australia, as my
imitators in those countries mostly made a terrible fiasco of the ghost
when they first attempted to show it.</p>

<p>The following notice by a newspaper, of which unfortunately the name
was cut off and lost, gives a very fair criticism on the ghost and its
inventors:—</p>

<p class="f120 spa2"><h2 class="nobreak">THE PATENT GHOST.</h2>

<p>“Modern researches in Spiritualism have led to one practical
result—the discovery of a ghost. Not of an ordinary old-fashioned
ghost, appearing in the midnight hour to people with a weak digestion,
haunting graveyards and old country mansions, and inspiring
romance-writers into the mischief of three-volume novels; but of a
well-behaved, steady, regular, and respectable ghost, going through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
a prescribed round of duties, punctual to the minute—a Patent Ghost,
in fact. This admirable ghost is the offspring of two fathers, of
a learned member of the Society of Civil Engineers, Henry Dircks,
Esq., and of Professor Pepper, of the Polytechnic. To Mr. Dircks
belongs the honour of having invented him, or, as the disciples of
Hegel would express it, evolved him from out of the depths of his own
consciousness; and Professor Pepper has the merit of having improved
him considerably, fitting him for the intercourse of mundane society,
and even educating him for the stage. After having bowed to the public
at the Polytechnic Institution, he some weeks ago made his <i>début</i>
upon the boards of the Britannia Theatre, in a new and highly original
drama, entitled, ‘The Widow and Orphans,—Faith, Hope, and Charity,’
in which piece he continues to present himself nightly to crowded
audiences with the greatest imaginable success.</p>

<p>“Possibly, all Britons do not know where the Britannia Theatre is
situated, and it may not be necessary, therefore, to state that it
has its place in the metropolitan suburb of Hoxton, inhabited chiefly
by toy-makers and doll-dressers, and marked under the letter <b>N</b>
by the Postmaster-General. Sceptics may smile at the idea of a Patent
Ghost making his first appearance in a neighbourhood so little
fashionable, and so far removed from the residence of Master Home,
commander-in-chief of spirits and mediums, and solicitor-general of
demons, ghosts, and shadows of the universe. It is no mere accident;
for it appears that there are good spiritual reasons why the ghost
should have come out at Hoxton and nowhere else. Here, in this
toy-making quarter, there lived, about a hundred years ago, a worthy
citizen and officer of the Lord Mayor, Mr. Francis Bancroft, who was
haunted all his life long with the one great idea that his body was
predestined to arise visibly from the dead, and to wander over British
earth in the shape of a tangible ghost. So deeply impressed was he with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
this belief that, while walking in the flesh, his chief object was to
take measures towards insuring his safe and speedy resurrection. With
considerable faith in the celebrated maxim of Luther’s active Roman
antagonist, indulgence-selling Monk Tetzel:</p>

<ul class="index no-wrap">
<li class="isub1">‘<i>Sobald das Geld im Kasten klingt</i></li>
<li class="isub1">&nbsp;<i>Die Seel’ aus dem Fegfeuer springt</i>’</li>
<li class="isub1">&nbsp;</li>
<li class="isub1">(As soon as the money rattles in the boxes,</li>
<li class="isub1">&nbsp;The soul jumps out of purgatory.)</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">citizen Bancroft took great care, during his
mortal career, to accumulate a respectable amount of cash with the
object of forming a bribe for the guardians of his body. Accordingly,
in his will he left the sum of twenty-eight thousand pounds for the
establishment of schools and almshouses, with this proviso, that his
body should be ‘preserved within a shew glass’ in the church.”</p>

<p>During the time I was in Paris, and arranging the ghost for exhibition
at the Théâtre du Châtelet under Mons. Hostein, I was surprised to
find that the conjuror, Mons. Robin, was showing the ghost at his
séances. My lawyers interviewed him, and discovered that, some years
before, a little toy had been brought out and patented in France by
which a miniature ghost could be shown. It consisted of a box with a
small sheet of glass, placed at an angle of forty-five degrees, and it
reflected a concealed table, with plastic figures, the spectre of which
appeared behind the glass, and which young people who possessed the toy
invited their companions to take out of the box, when it melted away,
as it were, in their hands and disappeared.</p>

<p>In France at that time all improvements on a patent fell to the
original patentee, and under that law I lost the patent in France; but
Mons. Hostein honourably paid me a large sum of money for the use of
my improved ghost at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris. Query.—Had Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
Dircks’ patent agent, in his searches after patents, ever come across
the toy invented in Paris? Because it is substantially the ghost
apparatus and produced that illusion; and thus it shows how correct are
the words of Solomon, who has told us “There is nothing new under the sun.”</p>

<p>If the reader will consult a book written by me, entitled “Cyclopædic
Science Simplified,” formerly published by Messrs. Frederick Warne and
Co., but now bought and published by Messrs. Lippincott, the great
American publishers of Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.A., he will find a very
near approach to the ghost apparatus copied from Robinson’s “Recreative
Memories” published in 1831. The same author describes how the famous
magician (so-called) Nostrodamus deceived even the astute and wily
Marie de’ Medicis by a vision which appeared in a looking-glass.
Moreover, Sir Walter Scott, in his beautiful poem, “The Lay of the Last
Minstrel,” has introduced the use of mirrors for producing ghostly
appearances, in the vision seen by the ill-fated Earl of Surrey, in
the mirror huge and high of Cornelius; the vision being “That fair and
lovely form, the Lady Geraldine” (verses 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, canto vi.).</p>

<p>Before travelling about so much I had a trunk full of letters referring
to the ghost illusion, many treating it as a supernatural phenomenon,
and not an effect from natural causes.</p>

<p>In about four months my secretary wrote at least 1,000 letters in
answer to those addressed to me.</p>

<p>I was offered house property in exchange for the right to exhibit the
ghost and a full description of the apparatus on attendance at the
Polytechnic to see how things were manipulated.</p>

<p>I publish one of the most amusing letters, which has no address or
proper signature, but only the initials “R. C.”:—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Whereas the directors and managers of the Polytechnic Institution
believe and maintain the phenomenon called ‘spirit-rapping’ to be
produced by trickery, jugglery, or some natural agency, and to be an
imposture, I, the undersigned, on the contrary maintain that there
is some non-human agent which moves the tables, chairs, etc., and
carries on an intelligent conversation with spectators by knocking,
or tilting, or other signs. I am ready to wager from £5 to £50 with
any one who chooses to accept my challenge that the phenomenon shall
take place, and that no one present shall be able to detect any sort
of trickery or jugglery in the matter. It is to be clearly understood
that mere opinions that the thing is done by natural agency are to go
for nothing. The natural agency <i>must be proved</i>. On the other
hand I defy any one to produce the same phenomenon by natural agency
<i>without my being able to detect that agency</i>. In making this
proposal I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not place
any trust or confidence in the so-called ‘spirits,’ as I maintain, in
opposition to the whole body of so-called ‘spiritualists,’ that the
intelligent agent which moves the tables, chairs, etc., and converses
and answers questions by knocking, is nothing more or less than <i>the
evil spirit</i> which dwells in humanity, and is found in
every human being. This proposition can be clearly demonstrated. As
to the so-called ‘spirits’ being the ‘souls of the dead,’ the idea
is absurd, and this absurdity also can be made abundantly manifest.
This spiritualism is doing an immensity of mischief, and ought to
be exposed, but it will never be exposed if people shut their eyes
<i>to the fact</i>. It will not be the less a fact, and will not the
less impose on all who witness it, because there are men and women
who <i>predetermine</i> in their own minds that it cannot be true,

that it is an intelligent, and a wonderfully intelligent, agent, and
then it will remain to be considered whether this intelligent agent is
good or evil—<i>I say it is evil</i>.</p>

<p class="author spb1">R. C.”</p>

<p>During the year 1863, when the ghost illusion was one of the topics of
the day, the famous George Cruikshank wrote a pamphlet, entitled—“A
Discovery concerning Ghosts, with a Rap at the ‘Spirit Rappers,’
illustrated with Cuts, and dedicated to the ‘Ghost Club.’” Curious
to say, he says nothing respecting the Polytechnic ghost, but is
exercised chiefly with famous stories of ghosts and apparitions, which
it is alleged have appeared to various persons. The author examines
analytically a number of them, and comes to the conclusion that the
persons relating them usually deceived themselves or other people, and
that most of the stories are mental hallucinations. The inimitable
George, as his friends delighted to call him, treats with profound
contempt the spirit rappers, and all the cheats and fortune-telling
mendicants who try to impose on innocent people with their bad
conjuring tricks—people who might have got through the world safely;
but the fatal chord is struck, and they go from bad to worse, until
they end in a mad house.</p>

<p>The whole tribe of persons who made money directly or indirectly out
of what they called spirit mediums, &amp;c., fairly howled upon me in
the lecture room, and, threatening personal violence, I was for some
time attended home at night by the most stalwart of our Polytechnic
employés; for, like Cruikshank, I vigorously denounced the traders in
spirits, founding my arguments on the belief that God was too merciful
to us to add to the troubles of this world the fear and trembling
brought about by pretended communication with the invisible world.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The first story I told at my Polytechnic “Strange Lecture” had a very
simple plot.</p>

<p>It represented the room of a student who was engaged burning the
midnight oil, and, looking up from his work, sees an apparition of
a skeleton. Resenting the intrusion he rises, seizes a sword or a
hatchet which is ready to his hand, and aims a blow at the ghost; which
instantly disappeared again and again to return.</p>

<p>This ghost was admirably performed by my assistant, whom we called Ye
Perringe, who, wearing a cover of black velvet, held the real skeleton
in his arms and made the fleshless bones assume the most elegant
attitudes, the lower part from the pelvis downward being attired in
white linen, and the white skeleton ghost assuming a sitting posture,
so that it appeared to come out of the floor.</p>

<p>Although this exhibition only lasted a few minutes, it drew hundreds
and thousands of pounds to the treasury of the Polytechnic. In fact, as
already stated, I was obliged to remove to the larger theatre of the
Institute.</p>

<p>The next ghost story was told in the large theatre; and it illustrated
Charles Dickens’s story of the “Haunted Man.” At the same time was
shown “Cupid and the Love-Letter.” When the curtain drew up, a peasant
girl was discovered using her spinning-wheel and demurely thinking of
something not told to the audience.</p>

<p>The ghost of a very pretty little boy dressed as Cupid now appears at
her elbow, and discharges an arrow from his bow, which pierces the
heart of the susceptible village girl. She attempts to caress the
pretty Cupid, who eludes her kind advances, and is now discovered on
the other side. The maiden turns to kiss him, but he is gone. At last,
relenting, Cupid gives her a love-letter from some affectionate swain,
which she takes and shows triumphantly to the audience, and leaving the
girl to read it, the curtain again descended. These two illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
of the ghost illusion ran for fifteen months without alteration, and
were succeeded by many others—viz., Scrooge and Marley’s Ghost, by
Charles Dickens; the Ghost of the diving bell; the knight watching his
armour; the poor author tested; the Ghost of Napoleon I. at St. Helena;
and the Ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>, pronounced by a leading R.A. as being
nearly perfect, only wanting a little different colour in the walls
of the ramparts, which I adopted with his ultimate satisfaction and
approval.</p>

<p>The late Walter Montgomery took a great interest in the ghost
proceedings, and assisted me greatly in arranging the scenes with due
regard to the dramatic art. There is a mystery about his tragic end
which deserves solution, and his brother-in-law told me at Brisbane,
Queensland, that he did <i>not</i> commit suicide, but was shot by
somebody else.</p>

<p>The sands of the year 1863 had been nearly run out, and I had taken the
ghost to Manchester to a lecture hall then under the skilful management
of Mr. Peacock, when another great success was scored—various London
theatres took out licences to use the ghost; notably the Haymarket,
under Mr. Benjamin Webster; The Britannia, under Mr. and Mrs. Lane;
Drury Lane, under Mr. Chatterton, also subsequently and after the
famous ghost trial before the Lord Chancellor. The Music Halls no
longer tried to infringe the patent, but those who required it paid
their fees for licences to do so.</p>

<p>The famous ghost trial came on in September at the private residence of
the Lord Chancellor Westbury, who very graciously agreed to hear this
patent case at once, because his lordship was informed by my solicitor,
Mr. Walter Hughes, junr., that if he could not do so the Polytechnic
Ghost would most likely be swamped by the multiplicity of imitators,
good, bad, or indifferent.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one cold and chilly day I went down into Hampshire,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
accompanied only by my solicitor, Mr. Walter Hughes, junior, of the
firm of Hughes, Masterman, and Hughes, 56, New Broad Street. On arrival
we were shown into his Lordship’s drawing-room, where, to my dismay,
I found a little army of solicitors and barristers drawn up as if in
battle array, and sitting in a row against the right-hand wall of the room.</p>

<p>His Lordship’s secretary courteously came forward, and, noticing we
were somewhat cold, placed chairs for us near the fire, and pulled up a
table for our use on which to take notes.</p>

<p>We all rose respectfully when the Lord Chancellor entered, and, being
requested by him to remain seated, the case was opened by his Lordship
asking who appeared for the Plaintiffs, the music hall proprietors. At
least four answered, “I do, my Lord,” and we in the minority could only
give an answer from one voice—viz., that of my then young solicitor.</p>

<p>The music hall people came down with two newspaper reporters to record
their certain victory over me, but which, as it turned out, was a
mistake, because the reporters could only tell the truth and record the
verdict given in my favour.</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor, so far as I can remember (and I have no notes),
then addressed the Plaintiffs—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">1st. I shall require you to show cause by what right or
authority you appear before me this day.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">2nd. I will hear you on the general merits of the case.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">3rd. And lastly, on the novelty which the Defendant seeks to have
completed under the protection of a Patent, and which novelty you
appear to deny.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the barristers then rose, and after saying that he would bow
with submission to anything his Lordship might suggest or rule,
commenced his argument by calling attention to the fact that the number
of days allowed by the Patent Law had already elapsed, and by sections
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
so-and-so I had lost the opportunity of getting the Patent sealed
within the proper time allowed between granting Provisional Protection
and sealing the Patent.</p>

<p>After he had ended, the Lord Chancellor asked if the Plaintiffs through
their counsel had anything more to urge on this first point. They all
bowed, and said “No.”</p>

<p class="spb2">His Lordship now said: “It is very true what you state
respecting the wording of the Patent Act, <i>but</i> if you will turn
to sections so-and-so you will find that the Law Officers of the Crown
have full power to grant an extension of the time for completing
and sealing the Patent on the proper application of the Defendant’s
solicitors, and as that application has already been made and granted,
it must be evident that, though the Defendant exceeded the time
usually allowed, he had full permission to do so from the constituted
authorities. I will now hear you on the general merits of the case.”</p>

<p>Here the learned counsel exhausted his law and rhetoric in making
out there was really nothing to patent, for who could catch hold of
a ghost? And more legal technicalities were advanced and argued than
I can remember at this distance of time—viz., twenty-six years ago.
However, his Lordship again asked, “Have you anything more to urge
on this point?” and received the same reply, “No, my Lord, we have
not.” The Chancellor then replied <i>in extenso</i>, exposed all the
sophistries of the arguments, and whilst complimenting the counsel on
his learning and the care which he had bestowed upon the case, said
again that there was nothing in the arguments that militated against
the sealing of the Patent. Of course, they could take action at common
law, and try the case before the judges appointed to try such cases
if they thought proper, and, supported by affidavits resulting from a
trial at common law, could bring the case again before him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>There was one point which the Lord Chancellor alluded to. He said:
“Great stress had been laid on the impossibility of patenting a mere
intangible nothing, viz., a ghost; but as he understood, the Defendant
did not patent the shadowy result called the Ghost, but an apparatus
for ‘Exhibiting Dramatic and other Performances,’ and without this
apparatus no ghost could be rendered visible to an audience.” His
lordship then continued: “I will now hear you on the novelty of the
proposed invention, which your affidavits declare is not new, but an
imitation of something already exhibited.”</p>

<p>The learned counsel now made various statements, supported apparently
by affidavits from persons who alleged that they had seen the ghost
a long time before, and, in fact, had used the very same apparatus I
had employed or words to that effect. For instance, an old playbill
emanating from the Old Tivoli Gardens, Margate—not perhaps the most
refined place of entertainment, in fact, no ladies appeared to visit
the place say, in 1851, when I heard a lady in tights discourse a song
the burthen of which was—</p>

<ul class="index no-wrap">
<li class="isub1">“Take care, John Bull, or else you’ll be done</li>
<li class="isub1">&nbsp; In the Great Exhibition of ’51.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The playbill was laid upon his Lordship’s table, who, taking hold
of it, asked, “Is this the playbill alluded to?” and threw it on
the floor. I suppose the counsel was not attending to some point of
etiquette, and ought to have produced his playbill in the form of a
High Chancery Court affidavit. The playbill alluded to a ghost that was
to be shown, and counsel again called attention to their plan of the
ghost apparatus, which he was instructed to say was the same or very
similar to that used by Defendant. The affidavit of some other dramatic
professional was also brought forward with several others; but all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
things come to an end, and at last the same distinct question rang out:
“Have you anything more to urge on this question of novelty?” with the
answer as before. “No, your Lordship.”</p>

<p>Lord Westbury commenced by alluding to the drawing brought forward
by the Plaintiffs, and said, “I have examined the affidavit and
the drawings, and find it is as nearly as possible a copy of the
Defendant’s own drawing deposited in confidence in the archives of
the Patent Office, and when I visit that establishment will take care
to enquire who has presumed to allow the Plaintiffs permission to
copy the Defendant’s original drawing of the apparatus used to show
the ghost. I well remember,” continued his Lordship, “being taken
to the house of Belzoni, the distinguished traveller, and seeing an
effect no doubt somewhat similar to that produced by the Defendant’s
apparatus, but I could not for one moment compare the toy of Belzoni
with the refined and complete contrivances used by the Defendant at
the Royal Polytechnic. An affidavit has been put in by the Plaintiffs,
sworn to by a person calling himself a ‘nigger minstrel.’ He is
elsewhere denominated an ‘Ethiopian Serenader,’ who had seen the
Defendant’s ghost shown years ago—a very respectable man, no doubt,
in his vocation; but to put the evidence of such a person against
the affidavits of Michael Faraday, Sir David Brewster, and Professor
Wheatstone, is a manifest absurdity. I, therefore, rule that the Great
Seal of England be at once attached to the Defendant’s patent, and that
the Plaintiffs do pay the costs.”</p>

<p>After certifying for the costs and having a little conversation with
my solicitor and self, his Lordship withdrew, and we all went back
to town. The reader can imagine my feelings of joy at the successful
upshot of this trial when he learns that I had already received large
sums for licences which I must have refunded if the case had gone
against me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>For many years the ghost at the Polytechnic pursued its successful
career, and earned £12,000 in a comparatively short space of time. I
received an illuminated address of thanks, with a handsome honorarium,
from the directors, and subsequently they presented my bust in marble
to my late dear wife, with a letter from the Rev. J. B. Owen, M.A., the
highly-gifted chairman of the old Royal Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Very few persons could understand how the ghost was produced, although
many persons wrote about and explained it; even the distinguished
philosopher, Michael Faraday, when I took him behind the scenes, said,
with his usual love of truth: “Do you know, Mr. Pepper, I really don’t
understand it.” I then took his hand, and put it on one of the huge
glass plates, when he said, “Ah! now I comprehend it; but your glasses
are kept so well protected I could not see them even behind your
scenes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">METEMPSYCHOSIS.</h2>

<p>Since the ghost was produced at the Polytechnic years ago, the author
has visited America, and seen not only the chief cities of the United
States of America, but also those of patriotic Canada; and about ten
years ago, paying a casual visit to Messrs. Walker, the eminent organ
builders, he enquired of Mr. James Walker what he had done with a model
shown him during the height of the popularity of the ghost, by which an
empty glass goblet, or one full of water, was gradually filled with, or
changed into, wine (or coloured water resembling it), thus unwittingly
and apparently embodying or putting into an illustrated form the
miracle of the conversion of water into wine.</p>

<p>I was too busy and too well paid at the time to think of a new
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
illusion, but I praised it much, and said if not confined to too small
stage limits, it was certainly as good, if not better, than the ghost
illusion.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when the London world was ready for something
new (as commercial men would say) in the ghost line, and although Mr.
James Walker, with the modesty of a truly scientific man, disclaimed
the merit due to his invention, he did at last, at my request, throw
himself, with the author, heart and soul into the production of the
new illusion, which we called Metempsychosis. We now took out a patent
for the new optical wonder, and having thus secured the invention from
that piracy and robbery which too often dog the otherwise successful
steps of inventors, causing nearly every patent to be called by the
legal fraternity a <i>damnosa hereditas</i>, we looked about for a
good place—hall or theatre—where the illusion could be started. None
better could be thought of than the old Royal Polytechnic, where we
offered at a moderate sum per week to produce it, paying for every
stick, decoration, or engraved looking-glass ourselves. But it appeared
that the funds of the institution were so reduced—it was supposed,
by the immense expenditure on armies, warlike material, and ladies’
legs required to produce a work emulating friend Barnum’s gigantic
“Nero,” and called, with an alarming stretch of imagination, the “Siege
of Troy,” or “Destruction of Troy”—that the directors were unable
to guarantee the weekly salary Mr. James Walker and myself demanded.
Luckily for us, a percentage on the gross receipts was suggested, and
brought in a great deal more money to our exchequer than the modest
weekly salary would have given us. The public came in goodly numbers
to see the new optical wonder, and all went well as long as the author
remained in London and could devote his time and energies to the daily
exhibition; but the time was now drawing rapidly near when, according
to contract, he must leave for Australia.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Professor Pepper has invariably told his numerous patrons that,
although obliged to keep secret for a reasonable time all optical
illusions that he produced, he would ultimately tell the public all
about it.</p>

<p>The metempsychosic era at the Polytechnic in 1879 was marked by the
production of various stories, which were nicely edited and corrected
by a lady of well-balanced, tasteful, and poetic mind—viz., by Miss
Walker, the sister of the author’s very able coadjutor.</p>

<p>The entertainment opened with a vacant stage, disclosing a sort of
inner apartment about twelve feet square, tastefully upholstered,
and closed by a curtain which could be lowered at pleasure, without
interfering with the great roller and white curtain upon which
Dissolving Views were shown. The author’s adopted son, for he never
had any children of his own, was now seen walking through the inner
apartment to the foot-lights, where he bowed and, addressing the
audience, had hardly got as far as the words, “Ladies and Gentlemen,—I
am sorry to inform you that something has detained Professor
Pepper—” when my voice was heard crying out: “Stop, stop; I am
here!” and, appearing out of nothing and without the aid of trap doors
or descent by the help of the copper wires, the author stood in the
midst, and bowed his acknowledgments for the hearty greeting kindly
given him by his audience. The entertainment now proceeded, and, after
apologising for the gloom he was about to cast upon the meeting by the
harassing story he was about to relate, finally stated that his subject
would be those “fearful bags of mystery” called “sausages,” remarking
incidentally that though, thanks to Government analysts, many persons
had heard of the examination and analyses of this dietetic refresher
of the inner man, no one probably had ever seen sausages put together
again, as it were, and formed into the very animal from which they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
originally educed. A large white dish of sausages was now produced.
They were placed in a wire basket, such as pot-plants are suspended in
from windows and verandahs, and hung up in the inner chamber. About
one minute elapsed; the sausages were gone, and out of the basket
came the author’s dear little sagacious white poodle, with his blue
ribbon and little bells, wagging his tail, barking at the audience, and
coming down to lick the hand of his master. The poor little creature
was accidentally poisoned by eating bits of meat the rats had dropped
whilst scuttling to their holes to die of the too rapid poison prepared
by the author for those pests of domesticated people.</p>

<p>Then the metamorphoses proceeded. Oranges were changed into pots of
marmalade, and given away to the boys, and a chest of tea was converted
into a tray carrying a steaming teapot, sugar, milk, cups of tea,
and handed by the attendants to the ladies in the <i>reserved</i>
seats only—such is the blighting influence of cash, which caused the
one-shilling people to be neglected and the eighteenpenny-reserved-seat
folks to have their teas. The ghost of Banquo in “Macbeth,” and the
ditto in “Hamlet” followed, with the curious change of a deserted piano
into one at which played and sang a living member of the fair sex,
attended by a gentleman in faultless black coat and white tie, who
turned over her music; and this Part. I wound up with the change of a
gentleman into a lady, who walked down to the foot-lights, sang a song,
and then vanished into “thin air.”</p>

<p>But all these changes could only happen in the smaller inner apartment,
the actors might walk anywhere else at pleasure, and out of the charmed
circle Walker could not change to Pepper, or the latter refer to the
living beings when they faded out of sight as regular “Walkers.”</p>

<p>So much for what was done, and now the anxious reader is getting
impatient, and if a lady is doubtless curious (the poor men never are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
so) to know how it was all done, and as the illusion has apparently
left the domain of optical science and is now relegated to the
conjuring profession, the author has no hesitation in fulfilling his
long-ago promise made to the public to let, as Mr. Cremer, jun., says
in his most amusing book on “Conjuring,” the cat out of the bag.</p>

<p>Before the illusion can please the eyes, the proper apparatus for
producing it must be constructed; and the key to the result consists in
the use, not of clear plate glass employed in the ghost illusion, but
of engraved silvered glass.</p>

<p>Ordinary looking-glass, such as is used for common mirrors or
looking-glasses, is usually made by attaching an amalgam of tin-foil
and quicksilver to one side of a clean sheet of plate or other glass.</p>

<p>Glass prepared in this way cannot be successfully engraved, and when
the chisel or other tool is drawn with pressure across it, is liable to
chip; and instead of clear, sharp engraved lines being obtained, they
are ragged, and, in most cases, large patches of the amalgam are torn off.</p>

<p>This is not the case when glass really silvered by successful chemical
processes is used, and when pure metallic silver is precipitated on to
the surface of the best and flattest plate glass. When Mr. Walker and
myself commenced our experiments in March, 1879, the so-called “Patent
Silvered Glass” was expensive and confined to moderate-sized pieces of
plate glass. Our first care, therefore, was to construct a table that
could be brought by screws to a perfect level, and one that would carry
a plate of glass at least twelve feet six long by six feet eight wide.
Such a plate being most carefully cleaned, and quite free from grease,
was placed upon the table, and levelled by means of spirit levels,
just as a plate of glass used for the old collodion process would be
levelled, in order that the fluid should not run off at one edge,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
leaving the other comparatively dry; and now came the knotty
point—Which was the best silvering process to use? On consulting
the best records of this art, we found valuable information in the
<i>English Mechanic</i>, Vol. xxi., No. 542.</p>

<p>The reader will find the following process very successful if minutely
carried out in all its technical details—</p>

<p class="f110"><span class="smcap">To Silver Glass.</span></p>

<p>Prepare two solutions.</p>

<p>1. Argentic nitrate is dissolved in distilled water, and ammonia added
to the solution till the precipitate first thrown down is almost
entirely re-dissolved. The solution is filtered and diluted, so that
100 cc. contain one gramme of argentic nitrate.</p>

<p><b>N.B.</b>—100 cc. are equal to rather more than 3½ fluid ounces.</p>

<p>2. Two grammes of argentic nitrate are dissolved in a little distilled
water, and poured into a litre of boiling distilled water. 1·66 gramme
of Rochelle salt is added, and the mixture boiled for a short time, till
the precipitate contained in it becomes grey; it is then filtered hot.</p>

<p>The glass, having been thoroughly cleaned with (1) nitric acid, (2)
water, (3) caustic potash, (4) water, (5) alcohol, and lastly distilled
water, is to be placed in a clean glass or porcelain vessel, the side
to be silvered being placed uppermost. Equal quantities of the two
solutions are then to be mixed and poured in, so as to cover the glass.
This should be done while the glass is still wet with distilled water.</p>

<p>In about an hour the silvering will be completed. Then pour off the
exhausted liquid, carefully remove glass, wash in clean water, rub off
silver where deposited where not required, allow to dry, and varnish
silvered side with any thin varnish which does not contract much in
drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>The time required for the operation depends on temperature.</p>

<p>If the solutions be warmed to about 30°C., the silver is deposited in a
few minutes; but it is safer to use them cold.</p>

<p>The inside of test tubes, bulbs, &amp;c., are silvered by putting the
solutions into them, no second vessel being then required.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole operation the most scrupulous cleanliness is the
grand essential.</p>

<p>100 cc. are equal to rather more than 3½ fluid ounces.</p>

<ul class="index no-wrap">
<li class="isub2">1 gramme = 15·432 grains.</li>
<li class="isub2">1 litre  = 35¼ fluid ounces.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plate of glass being thus carefully silvered is allowed to dry
thoroughly, and is finally varnished with a good thick varnish,
containing plenty of red lead, so that the back surface of the silver
mirror has a smooth and red appearance, while the varnish protects the
delicate film of metallic silver.</p>

<p>An ordinary photographic picture on glass is really represented by
precipitated metallic silver, but the metal in this case is in minute
particles, which do not shine or reflect light.</p>

<p>The silvered plate glass is now engraved in the following simple
manner. Being placed in a support or rack against the wall, and quite
upright, a chisel—or rather, a series of chisels—are drawn across the
surface in straight lines, and perpendicular, by the use of a large
<b>T</b>-square. Every time the chisel is drawn with pressure across
the varnished back of the glass a portion of the silver is removed,
leaving a straight line quite clear or transparent, and, in fact,
laying bare the surface of the plate glass.</p>

<p>The lines were ruled in three degrees of comparison: thick, thicker,
thickest; and considerable skill and experience—which no description
can teach—were required to get these correctly engraved.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span></p>

</div>

<p>The engraved silver glass plate moved through a groove in the
woodwork at the top of the chamber, and was supported below on a
beautiful carriage, the wheels of which were covered with vulcanised
indiarubber rings, and moved on a tramway below the floor of the
room, perpendicularly. The glass could be made to slide at an angle
of forty-five degrees, and as it always made a rumbling noise while
moving, the music of the band concealed that defect. The ground plan of
the apartment is shown on the opposite page.</p>

<p>Some idea of the cost of making a full-sized apparatus, with hangings
and curtains and engraved glass, may be gathered from the fact that
the author’s outfit for Australia with a certain number of dresses
cost £327 12s. 1d. Whilst the author was travelling through Australia
Mr. James Walker, with his great inventive genius, made a further
improvement, by which the concealed figure at <span class="allsmcap">k</span>
was done away with, and the whole apartment thrown open to the public
gaze. This was done to illustrate a clever sketch written by Mr.
Burnand called “Curried Prawns.”

<p><span class="smcap">a c d e</span> are the outside of the room, 12 feet square, engraved
glass running from <span class="smcap">h a</span> to <span class="smcap">a d</span>.
The wing <span class="smcap">e g</span> is placed square; this is an immense advantage,
as it renders unnecessary any counterpart at <span class="smcap">c n</span>, and as,
of course, it cannot be seen, the light from the foot-lights on <span class="smcap">e g</span>
is not seen by reflection at <span class="smcap">c n</span>. When the wing
<span class="smcap">e g</span> was at the same angle as <span class="smcap">h a</span>,
this was always a weak point in the illusion, as when the glass crossed, the reflection
of <span class="smcap">e g</span>, unless very dimly illuminated, always shewed. Now it
does not matter when <span class="smcap">e g</span> is placed as in drawing. The frontage
to the audience, instead of being from <span class="smcap">a f</span>, is now extended to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">e</span>—<i>i.e.</i> 12 feet—consequently the return sides
<span class="smcap">f e</span> and <span class="smcap">c b</span> can be removed.
This plan, of course, precludes the use of “trick” chairs, baskets, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
but it has a good many other advantages in its favour, for with a “sociable” in the
middle of the room made in two exact halves, these halves trick or cover one
another when the glass is pushed across, and of course this movement
is not seen by the audience; then any person or persons can be made to
appear gradually, sitting or standing, at <span class="allsmcap">l</span> or
<span class="allsmcap">m</span>, <i>right in the middle of the wide open room</i>.
Mr. Walker tried this effect at the Polytechnic Institution, and it was capital—the
ensemble is more imposing. This plan of shewing the illusion is the
plan for the stage, as the necessity for darkening the stage in front
is nearly wholly avoided. The back of the side-wing <span class="smcap">i k</span>
can be painted black, so that its reflection shall not be seen. In lieu of
the gas-jets, as now arranged, there is a gas-lamp; this is placed on a
pedestal or small table. The shadow of the “sociable” to a great extent
covers or hides the path along which the glass travels. Mr. Walker
says: “I thought out this way for Mr. Irving’s necessities, but I did
not hear anything from him; and it has come in well for Mr. Burnand’s
sketch, which has been produced.” In this sketch, a gentleman afflicted
with dyspepsia through eating “curried prawns” (the name of the piece),
calling on some friends, where he has promised to help them in some
amateur theatricals, looks at the different costumes of Mephistopheles,
Faust and Marguerite, and throws them carelessly on the seat at
<span class="allsmcap">m</span>, walks down the steps (which we shall double in width)
the glass now crosses, and, whilst in a fit of melancholy, he wonders if
Mephistopheles will appear. Sure enough, he does. Mephistopheles then
comes down in front, and with incantations makes, successively or together;
Faust and Marguerite appear; they then disappear in the same manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The author’s friends and the public all know how steadily he has
opposed the so-called <i>Spiritual deceptions</i>, which generally
are not a half nor a quarter as clever as the tricks of a first-rate
conjuror.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> instructs us what to do at a Spiritual séance, which, if
done, would certainly astonish the person performing the part of the
materialised spirit. <i>Punch</i> writes—“How to behave at a Spiritual
séance.—Always try to hit the happy Medium.”</p>

<p>The author thought the time had now arrived when a new generation who
knew not the ghost might be interested in its revival, and with that
idea the authorities at the present Polytechnic concurred, so that by
the time these pages are read it is hoped the ghost will be in full
career once more, and if the author only receives a tenth part of the
great patronage he received in 1863 he will be amply repaid for all his
exertions in reproducing the ghost illusion. And he desires thankfully
to acknowledge the very kind help he has received from Robert Mitchell,
Esq., the Secretary and Manager of the numerous classes and useful
lectures now so well conducted at Mr. Quintin Hogg’s Polytechnic.</p>

<p class="spa2">The author hopes to show “something new” at the
Polytechnic; and a lady in miniature, as it were from Liliput, dances
on a silver waiter held out by the author; and the great man Napoleon
I., for whom, like Alexander the Great, the world was too small, stands
in the palm of the hand of the author.</p>

<p>If “duffers,” &amp;c., did not exist, the illusion would be explained to
the public; but ten years need not elapse before they know all.</p>
